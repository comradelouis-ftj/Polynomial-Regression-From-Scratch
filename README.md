In this project, I try to create a polynomial regression model from scratch. Here, I try to predict the selling price of a car based on certain features (which would be explained later in the notebook) in the dataset that is used.

The source for this dataset can be found via this link:

note: to make it easier to access in this notebook, the dataset was placed in github.
