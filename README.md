**Project Overview**
---

In this project, I try to create a polynomial regression model from scratch. Here, I try to predict the selling price of a car based on certain features (which would be explained later in the notebook) in the dataset that is used.
Polynomial regression itself is an extension of linear regression, which applies the idea of linear regression on a much higher dimension, by creating polynomial features. For the purposes of this experiment, I would only use a degree of 2 for the polinomial features used.

note: to make it easier to access in this notebook, the dataset was placed in github.
